# Imporevements/To-do

(1) Have used GET method hence the parameters needs to be in the URL. To use to JSON as input, we can use a POST request where i can fetch the values from the request's body instead of the URL.

(2) More robust exception handling with proper error codes.

(3) I wanted to have the api presented in swagger which would've been really nice. But will be needing some more time for that, let me know if you want to see that. I can work on it over the weekend and maybe some other usecases which you might want to see.
